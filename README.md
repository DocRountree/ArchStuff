Configuration files and scripts for my personalised Arch Linux experience

I doubt these files will be of any use to anybody except me, but I'm making them public anyway.

Files for suckless utilities fall under the respective licenses for those utilities; the rest of the repo is in the public domain per the Creative Commons Zero license.
